<!--

   The herds dtd file is the authoritive source of all herds and their maintainers.
   Every herd is described in its own <herd> tag. A herd tag consists of a name,
   possibly an email address, a description and then a number of maintainers. In that order.

   The email subtag of the herds file can be used to specify the contact
   address for the herd.

   In most cases herds need to have at least one maintainer, preferably
   more. The necessary information about a maintainer is his/her email
   address. Further a name tag and description tags are allowed. The
   name tag is deprecated as the developer database will be used.

   Description tags can have lang attributes, in which case there must be
   always a description without a lang attribute. Also there are no overlapping
   descriptions allowed (multiple description tags with the same language)
