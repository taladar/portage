*signify-17 (17 Apr 2016)

  17 Apr 2016; Patrick Lauer <patrick@gentoo.org> +metadata.xml,
  +signify-17.ebuild:
  Initial import, ebuild by me.

  Linux port that diverges slightly from upstream so that it compiles nicely.
  Since there are no upstream releases to be found versioning is mildly
  random.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.28
