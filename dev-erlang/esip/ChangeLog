*esip-1.0.4 (07 Jun 2016)

  07 Jun 2016; Amadeusz Żołnowski <aidecoe@gentoo.org> +esip-1.0.4.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Add new package

  It is debundled from net-im/ejabberd-16.04 and therefore inherits
  keywords from ejabberd: ~amd64, ~arm, ~ppc and ~x86. ~ia64 and ~sparc
  are not inherited because other dependency is missing these keywords and
  there's no chance it can get them any time soon.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.0_rc1
