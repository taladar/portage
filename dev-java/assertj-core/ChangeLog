*assertj-core-2.3.0 (17 Jan 2016)

  17 Jan 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +assertj-core-2.3.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package, needed by latest testng's tests

  No tests on this one for now due to missing dependencies. This isn't
  the newest version but I don't know whether 3.x is compatible and it
  also requires Java 8, which might be inconvenient at present.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.2.26
