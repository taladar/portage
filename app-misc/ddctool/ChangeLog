*ddctool-0.4.2 (04 Sep 2016)

  04 Sep 2016; David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> +ddctool-0.4.2.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  New package

  ddctool primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface)
  to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control Command
  Set) over I2C. Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the
  I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n. Alternatively, there is initial
  support for monitors (such as Apple displays) that implement MCCS using
  a USB connection.
