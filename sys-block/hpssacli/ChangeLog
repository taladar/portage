  New package

  The HPE Smart Storage Administrator CLI (HPE SSACLI) is a commandline-based
  disk configuration program that helps you configure, manage, diagnose, and
  monitor HPE ProLiant Smart Array Controllers and now other storage devices
  as well, such as host bus adapters (HBAs), HPE Storage controllers, and
  future devices such as SCSI Express drives, and SAS switch devices. HPE
  SSACLI replaces the existing HP Array Configuration CLI Utility, or ACUCLI,
  with an updated design and will deliver new features and functionality for
  various Smart Storage initiatives as they come online.
