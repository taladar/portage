*llvm-ocaml-9999 (12 Nov 2016)

  +files/llvm-cmake-Remove-the-CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE-assertion.patch,
  +llvm-ocaml-9999.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Split OCaml bindings out of LLVM

  Introduce an ebuild to build LLVM OCaml bindings separately from LLVM
  itself. As pointed out by our OCaml team, the OCaml bindings have to be
  rebuilt much more frequently than LLVM itself (that is, on every
  dependency upgrade). Furthermore, OCaml tests seem to have problems
  running from build dir without LLVM installed. Therefore, use
  the LLVM_OCAML_OUT_OF_TREE build logic that was added for OPAM.
